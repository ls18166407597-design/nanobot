# Nanobot Strategic Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the long-term vision for Nanobot's evolution from a lightweight script to a resilient agentic platform.

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Enhancement (Completed)
- [x] **Premium Tool Suite**: Gmail, GitHub, Mac Control, and Knowledge Base (Obsidian) integration.
- [x] **Voice-to-Text**: Automatic transcription via Groq Whisper.
- [x] **Autonomous Verification**: Real-world verification for critical tasks.
- [x] **Lean Context**: Significant reduction in token usage and latency.
- [x] **Bilingual Support**: Full Chinese/English documentation and structure.

## 🚀 Phase 2: Intelligence & Scalability
- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Automatic system prompt updates based on registered tool schemas.
- **Conversation Pruning**: Infinite session length via smart history summarization.
- **Multi-Model Fallback**: Automatic failover between providers (Gemini, DeepSeek, local).
- **Subagent Parallelism**: Capability to spawn background subagents for long-running research tasks.

## 🎨 Phase 3: Multi-Modal & Rich UX
- **Vision Integration**: Ability to "see" and analyze screenshots/webpages natively.
- **GUI Deep Linking**: `obsidian://` and other protocol handlers for seamless desktop interaction.
- **Long-term Memory (RAG)**: Integration with local vector stores for deep document retrieval.
