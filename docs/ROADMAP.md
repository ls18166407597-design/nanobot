# Nanobot Strategic Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the long-term vision for Nanobot's evolution from a lightweight script to a resilient agentic platform.

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Enhancement (Completed)
- [x] **Premium Tool Suite**: Gmail, GitHub, Mac Control, and Knowledge Base (Obsidian) integration.
- [x] **Voice-to-Text**: Automatic transcription via Groq Whisper.
- [x] **Autonomous Verification**: Real-world verification for critical tasks.
- [x] **Lean Context**: Significant reduction in token usage and latency.
- [x] **Bilingual Support**: Full Chinese/English documentation and structure.

## ✅ Phase 2: Intelligence & Scalability (Completed)
- [x] **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Automatic system prompt updates based on registered tool schemas.
- [x] **Conversation Pruning**: Infinite session length via smart history summarization (Auto-Summarization).
- [x] **Long-term Memory (RAG)**: Light RAG implementation for context retrieval.
- [x] **Parallel Tool Execution**: Async concurrent tool usage for speed.
- [x] **LLM Safety Guard**: Semantic command auditing for enhanced safety.
- [x] **Subagent Parallelism**: Capability to spawn background subagents for long-running research tasks.
- [ ] **Multi-Model Fallback**: Automatic failover between providers (Gemini, DeepSeek, local).

## 🚀 Phase 3: Perceptual Autonomy (In Progress)
- [x] **Native Vision Integration**: Ability to "see" and analyze screenshots natively via macOS Vision.
- [x] **Desktop Control**: Full mouse/keyboard interaction via Peekaboo.
- [ ] **GUI Deep Linking**: `obsidian://` and other protocol handlers for seamless desktop interaction.
- [ ] **Deep Vector RAG**: Integration with local vector stores for deep document retrieval.
