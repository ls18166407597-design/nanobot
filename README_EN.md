## 📁 Separated Architecture (V2.0)

We have refactored the project into a "Triad" isolated architecture for long-term stability:

- **`nanobot/`** (Engine): Immutable core source code and base skills.
- **`workspace/`** (Brain): Your personalized prompts, skills, scripts, and memory.
- **`.home/`** (Runtime): Persistent configurations and logs.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Agentic Protocols**: Transparent delegation, ask on failure, and result verification.
- **macOS Native Vision**: AppKit-based app identification and OCR.
- **Smart Workspace**: Clean separation between system logic and user assets.

## 🤝 Documentation (Chinese)

- ⚙️ **[Configuration Guide](docs/配置指南.md)**
- 🗺️ **[Roadmap](docs/路线图.md)**
- 🏗️ **[Project Structure](docs/项目结构.md)**
